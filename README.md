# Self Balancing Robot using PID Control

This project implements a two-wheel self-balancing robot using MPU6050 and Arduino Nano.

## Components

Arduino Nano  
MPU6050 IMU  
Motor Driver  
DC Motors  

## Working

The robot uses MPU6050 to measure tilt angle.

A PID control algorithm adjusts motor speed to maintain balance.

## Skills Learned

PID Control  
Sensor interfacing  
Embedded systems  
Control systems
